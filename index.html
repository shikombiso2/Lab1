            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> My name is Shikombiso Mashele, coming to Wits I was not able to code and had zero knowledge in Computer Sciences. During the first weeks I was very confused, had no friends because of being an introvert and very lost for most classes. Right now, I do have a few friends, and I was able to make remarkable memories with them. I am able to code in Python, C++, Java , SQL and a bit of Mathematica. A lot of people told me that third year is hard so I am kind of scared. Hop-efully I will make most out of this year and learn new skills and get over some of my fears</p>

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>I was working on a project management app that is able to:Have a drill-down view where the CEO is able to overview the tasks and projects that are being done in the company,
                Have different charts like the Ganhtt chart to track the amount of work done vs the deadline of the project,
                Be able to have many users and classify them based on their role in the company. It was a very difficult project, and I am not finished with it</p>
